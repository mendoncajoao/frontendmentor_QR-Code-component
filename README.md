Frontend mentor - QR Code Component Challenge

This is a basic card layout with an image, a main header and a description paragraph.

The project was done using HTML and CSS.

A working deployment of this project can be seem at: https://frontendmentor-qr-code-component-pbck8co8w-mendoncajoao.vercel.app/

Any feedback on how to improve this would be very welcomed.
